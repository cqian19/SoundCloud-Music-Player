# Soundcloud-Music-Player

A desktop application that plays songs from a playlist from SoundCloud. Made using React and Electron as a learning exercise from [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-music-player-with-react-electron-i-setup-basic-concepts), with a few updates.

Run  
```
  npm install
  npm start
```
